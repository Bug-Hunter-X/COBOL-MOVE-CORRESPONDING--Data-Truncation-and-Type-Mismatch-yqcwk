MOVE CORRESPONDING WS-RECORD TO DB-RECORD.

This statement, while seemingly straightforward, can lead to unexpected issues if the structures of WS-RECORD and DB-RECORD aren't perfectly aligned in terms of data types, lengths, and order of elements.  If a field in WS-RECORD is larger than its corresponding field in DB-RECORD, you'll get a data truncation error.  If the data types differ, you could see unpredictable results.

Example:

01 WS-RECORD.
    05 WS-NAME PIC X(30).
    05 WS-AGE PIC 9(3).

01 DB-RECORD.
    05 DB-NAME PIC X(20).
    05 DB-AGE PIC 9(2).
